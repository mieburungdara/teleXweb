# teleXweb User Guide

Welcome to teleXweb! This application helps you manage your Telegram files and organize your digital life.

## Overview

teleXweb connects with your Telegram bot to store metadata about the files you send, allowing you to easily browse, search, and manage them through a web interface.

## Getting Started

### 1. Connecting Your Bot (Admin Only)

If you are an administrator, you'll first need to configure your Telegram bot within the Admin Panel. Ensure your bot is correctly set up to forward messages to teleXweb's webhook.

### 2. Uploading Files

Simply send any file (documents, photos, videos, audio) to your configured Telegram bot. teleXweb will automatically save the file's metadata, making it accessible through the web interface.
